# CS 447: Natural Language Processing (2025 Spring)

This repository contains my implementations for homework assignments from CS 447 (Spring 2025), focused on core NLP techniques using machine learning.

## Contents

- **hw1.py – Text Classification**  
  Implements a logistic regression model for binary text classification using bag-of-words features.

- **hw2.py – Word Embedding and Similarity**  
  Includes training a skip-gram model using negative sampling and analyzing learned word vectors.

- **hwk3.py – Neural Machine Translation**  
  Builds sequence-to-sequence models (RNN and Transformer) for Spanish-to-English translation.

- **hwk4.py – Dependency Parsing**  
  Implements a neural transition-based dependency parser based on a stack-buffer configuration.
